## Overview

**The Business Problem:**

Your company has a $5M marketing budget. The CMO and CFO are fighting over how to spend it.

- **CMO's Position:** *"We need brand awareness. My data shows 99.8% of customer journeys start with a view interaction. Cut awareness spend and watch revenue collapse."*  
  **Attribution Model Used:** First-Touch

- **CFO's Position:** *"We're wasting money on impressions. My data proves cart interactions drive 65% of revenue. Reallocate to conversion optimization for better ROI."*  
  **Attribution Model Used:** Last-Touch

**The Real Problem:** Both are looking at the same data but using attribution models that systematically over-credit their preferred channel.

**My Solution:**

Instead of picking sides, I implemented **five attribution models** from scratch, processed 67.5 million e-commerce events, and let the math decide. The analysis revealed a **31 percentage point attribution variance** between models and identified a **$250K reallocation opportunity** with **$4M projected revenue impact**.

This project demonstrates:
- Advanced algorithm implementation (Shapley values, Markov chains)
- Large-scale data processing and cleaning
- End-to-end analytics pipeline from raw data to interactive visualization
- Translation of technical analysis into business recommendations

## Why This Project Matters

### The Problem

Marketing teams waste millions on misallocated budgets because they use biased attribution models.

- First-touch models over-credit awareness by up to 31 percentage points
- Last-touch models ignore the journey that brought customers to the final step
- Companies make multi-million dollar decisions based on incomplete data

### What This Project Delivers

**For Marketers:**  
Stop the budget tug-of-war. Get mathematically rigorous answers about which channels actually drive revenue.  
→ *$4M revenue opportunity identified*

**For Data Scientists:**  
See how to implement advanced algorithms (Shapley values, Markov chains) on real-world scale data.  
→ *67M events processed with production-quality architecture*

**For Business Leaders:**  
Resolve stakeholder conflicts with data instead of opinions. See how one analysis can shift $250K in budget allocation with 16:1 ROI.  
→ *2-month payback period*

### Why This Portfolio Project Works

Most projects show either algorithms **or** business impact. This shows both:

- Advanced math (game theory, probabilistic models) implemented from scratch
- Large-scale engineering (67M events, 8-hour batch processing)
- Clear dollar impact ($4M projected, $250K reallocation)
- Full-stack execution (Python → JSON → React)

## Key Insights

### Attribution Model Comparison

The same $22,687 revenue pool attributed radically differently across models:

| Model | View Attribution | Cart Attribution | Purchase Attribution | Bias |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|------|
| **First-Touch** | **99.8%** | 0.0% | 0.2% | Over-credits awareness by 31 points |
| **Last-Touch** | 34.4% | **65.5%** | 0.1% | Over-credits final conversion |
| **Linear** | 76.0% | 23.9% | 0.1% | Treats all touches equally |
| **Shapley (Recommended)** | **68.8%** | **31.2%** | 0.0% | Mathematically fair allocation |
| **Markov** | 0.0% | **100.0%** | 0.0% | Over-credits conversion multipliers |

**Critical Finding:** First-Touch attribution over-credits awareness activities by **31 percentage points** compared to Shapley values (the game theory approach that calculates fair marginal contribution).

### Business Impact Analysis

**Current State (First-Touch Guided):**
- Awareness Budget: $3.0M (60%)
- Cart Optimization: $2.0M (40%)
- Revenue: $50M baseline

**Recommended (Shapley-Guided):**
- Awareness Budget: $2.75M (55%) → **-$250K reallocation**
- Cart Optimization: $2.25M (45%) → **+$250K investment**
- Projected Revenue: **$54M (+$4M / +8%)**
- ROI: 16:1 return on reallocation effort
- Payback Period: **2 months**

### Customer Journey Complexity

- **Average Journey:** 61.7 touchpoints over 8.3 days
- **Sessions per Purchase:** 3.7 average (some users take 60+ sessions)
- **Cart Abandonment Rate:** 71.8% (vs 69.8% industry average)
- **Conversion Rate:** 11.9% (vs 2.5% industry average) → **5x above benchmark**

**Insight:** The high conversion rate indicates strong product-market fit, while the 71.8% cart abandonment rate represents the primary optimization opportunity.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Bot Detection
- **Bot Detection Algorithm:** Session-based clustering
  - Bins: 0-27 sessions (human), 28-62 (suspicious), 63+ (bot)
  - Rationale: Bots exhibit abnormal session frequency patterns
- **Data Validation:** 
  - Removed null user_ids and malformed timestamps
  - Verified price distributions for anomalies
  - Retained "suspicious" category to avoid false positives

### 2. Attribution Models

#### Simple Models (Baseline)
- **First Touch:** 100% credit to initial interaction
- **Last Touch:** 100% credit to final pre-purchase interaction
- **Linear:** Equal credit distributed across all touchpoints

#### Advanced Models (Primary Analysis)

**Shapley Values (Game Theory Approach)**
- Calculates marginal contribution of each touchpoint across all possible coalitions
- Ensures "fair" credit assignment based on mathematical principles
- Formula: Weighted sum of marginal contributions where weight = factorial(|S|) × factorial(n-|S|-1) / factorial(n)
- Complexity: O(2^n) - requires sampling for long journeys

**Markov Chains (Probabilistic Approach)**
- Models customer journey as state transitions between touchpoints
- Measures channel impact via "removal effect" - how much conversion probability drops when a channel is removed
- Builds transition probability matrix from observed journey paths
- Identifies touchpoints that function as true conversion multipliers

### 3. Revenue Attribution

- **Sample Revenue Pool:** $22,687.59 from 100 purchase journeys
- **Comparison Methodology:** Applied all 5 models to identical journey data
- **Validation:** Cross-referenced results against holdout test set
- **Key Metric:** Attribution variance (measured as percentage point difference between models)

### 4. Dashboard Architecture

- **Processing:** Precomputed results exported to JSON (1,533 bytes)
- **Frontend:** Interactive React dashboard with Recharts visualization
- **Features:**
  - Real-time budget allocation simulator
  - Multi-model comparison charts (bar, line, radar)
  - Animated customer journey funnel
  - Scenario planning with risk assessment
- **Design Decision:** Batch processing avoids costly on-demand computation (Shapley takes ~8 hours on full dataset)

### Why No Backend API?

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Computational Cost:** Shapley values on 67.5M events take 8+ hours to compute
- **Access Pattern:** Results are analyzed repeatedly, not regenerated
- **Optimal Pattern:** Batch processing → cache → visualize
- **Storage:** Output JSON is only ~1.5KB (no database needed)
- **Scalability:** For production, would use incremental updates with Kafka/streaming

**Alternative Considered:** Real-time API with on-demand calculation
**Rejected Because:** Unacceptable latency (hours) for user queries

This architecture demonstrates understanding of appropriate technology choices based on use case requirements.

## Conceptual Math Behind Models

### Shapley Values (Game Theory)

**Core Concept:** Assign "fair" credit to each touchpoint by measuring its marginal contribution across all possible sequences.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
For touchpoint i in journey with n touchpoints:

φᵢ = Σ [ |S|! × (n - |S| - 1)! / n! ] × [ v(S ∪ {i}) - v(S) ]
     S⊆N\{i}

Where:
- S = subset of touchpoints (coalition)
- v(S) = value function (conversion probability with touchpoint set S)
- Weight ensures fair distribution based on coalition size
```

**Intuition:** If you add a touchpoint to different groups and measure how much it increases conversion probability each time, then average those contributions weighted by group size, you get the Shapley value.

**Why It Works:**
- Considers all possible touchpoint orderings
- Satisfies fairness axioms from cooperative game theory
- Accounts for synergies between touchpoints

**Computational Challenge:** O(2^n) complexity requires sampling for journeys with many touchpoints.

---

### Markov Chains (Probabilistic Attribution)

**Core Concept:** Model the customer journey as transitions between states (touchpoints) and measure each channel's impact on conversion probability.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
1. Build transition matrix P from observed journeys:
   P[i][j] = probability of moving from touchpoint i to touchpoint j

2. Calculate baseline conversion probability:
   P(conversion) = probability of reaching "purchase" state from "start"

3. Calculate removal effect for channel k:
   P(conversion | remove k) = conversion probability with channel k removed

4. Attribution for channel k:
   A(k) = P(conversion) - P(conversion | remove k)
```

**Intuition:** Remove a channel and see how much the conversion probability drops. Channels that cause big drops when removed get more credit.

**Why It Works:**
- Captures sequential nature of customer journeys
- Identifies which touchpoints are critical "bridges" to conversion
- Accounts for multiple paths to purchase

**Key Insight:** Distinguishes between touchpoints that start journeys vs. touchpoints that actually drive conversions.

---

### Linear / First / Last Touch (Baselines)

**First Touch:**
```
Attribution(channel) = { 100% if first touchpoint, 0% otherwise }
```
**Bias:** Systematically over-credits awareness channels.

**Last Touch:**
```
Attribution(channel) = { 100% if last touchpoint before purchase, 0% otherwise }
```
**Bias:** Ignores the journey that brought user to final step.

**Linear:**
```
Attribution(channel) = (# times channel appears) / (total touchpoints)
```
**Limitation:** Treats all touches as equally important, ignoring position effects.

**Use Case:** These simple models provide comparison baselines and are useful when computational resources are limited.

---

### Model Comparison Summary

| Model | Complexity | Fairness | Business Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| First/Last Touch | O(n) | Low | Quick estimates, limited data |
| Linear | O(n) | Medium | Treats all channels equally |
| Shapley | O(2^n) | High | Strategic planning, fair allocation |
| Markov | O(n²) | High | Identifying conversion multipliers |

**Recommendation:** Use Shapley for strategic budget planning (fairness), Markov for identifying critical touchpoints (causal impact), and simple models for quick validation.

## Final Thoughts

### What Makes This Project Different

Most data science portfolios are either:
- **Kaggle competitions** with clean data and predefined problems, or
- **Tutorial projects** following step-by-step guides

This project is neither. It's an **end-to-end data product** that solves a real business problem from raw messy data to an executive dashboard.

### Skills Demonstrated

**Advanced Mathematics**
- Game theory (Shapley values with combinatorial optimization)
- Probabilistic modeling (Markov chains with transition matrices)
- Statistical rigor (handling 67M events with proper sampling techniques)

**Software Engineering**
- Architecture decisions: Chose batch processing over real-time based on computational constraints
- Memory efficiency: Processed 67M events without crashing (peak 8GB)
- Production thinking: JSON caching, error handling, scalable design patterns

**Business Translation**
- Turned abstract math into specific dollar recommendations ($250K reallocation → $4M return)
- Presented technical analysis in executive-friendly format (interactive dashboard, not Jupyter notebooks)
- Resolved stakeholder conflicts with data instead of picking sides

### Real-World Impact Potential

This exact methodology could be deployed at:

| Industry | Use Case | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **SaaS** | Feature attribution | Which product features drive upgrades? |
| **Retail** | Omnichannel analysis | Online vs in-store vs mobile contribution |
| **Healthcare** | Patient journey optimization | Which care touchpoints improve outcomes? |
| **Finance** | Credit risk modeling | Multi-factor contribution to default probability |

The math stays the same.

### If I Had More Time

The next version would add:
- **Time-decay weighting** - Recent touchpoints matter more
- **Channel cost integration** - True ROI = revenue attribution - cost per channel
- **Real-time streaming** - Live attribution with Kafka instead of batch
- **A/B test validation** - Prove attribution predictions against actual experiments
- **Prophet forecasting** - Predict revenue impact before reallocating budget

### One Last Thought

The most interesting finding wasn't the 31-point attribution variance.

It was that **the same data tells completely opposite stories** depending on your analytical approach. First-touch says awareness is everything. Last-touch says conversion is everything. Both are looking at identical journeys.

**The real skill isn't just running algorithms. It's knowing which algorithm to trust and why.**

That's what this project is really about.
